# Breast-Cancer-Survival-Prediction
Breast cancer is the second leading cause of death in women. As the use of data in healthcare is very common today, we can use machine learning to predict whether a patient will survive a deadly disease or not.
We have a dataset of breast cancer patients who underwent surgery for the treatment of breast cancer. Below is the information of all columns in the dataset: Patient_ID: ID of the patient // Age: Age of the patient // Gender: Gender of the patient // Protein1, Protein2, Protein3, Protein4: expression levels // Tumor_Stage: Breast cancer stage of the patient // Histology: Infiltrating Ductal Carcinoma, Infiltration Lobular Carcinoma, Mucinous Carcinoma // ER status: Positive/Negative // PR status: Positive/Negative // HER2 status: Positive/Negative // Surgery_type: Lumpectomy, Simple Mastectomy, Modified Radical Mastectomy, Other // DateofSurgery: The date of Surgery // DateofLast_Visit: The date of the last visit of the patient // Patient_Status: Alive/Dead our task is to predict whether a breast cancer patient will survive or not after the surgery.
